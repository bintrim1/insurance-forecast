# Insurance Forecast
Using machine learning for multiple purposes across an insurance customer dataset. In this, we predict similar members and predict whether or not customers will make claims.

## Project Goal
The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of Machine Learning, and you are asked to evaluate that possibility.

**Task 1:** Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.\
**Task 2:** Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a trained prediction model do better than an untrained dummy model? Can it do worse? Explain your logic.\
**Task 3:** Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model.\
**Task 4:** Protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.
